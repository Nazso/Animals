                <h2>Information about dogs</h2>
                <p>
                    The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
                    domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
                    relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before
                    the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of
                    domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
                    canids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
                    attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
                    herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled
                    people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic
                    of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds. In the Victorian era,
                    directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes. Most breeds
                    were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid
                    phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull,
                    body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be
                    found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include
                    body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and
                    hunting, retrieving, and scent detection. Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and
                    aggression, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[8] As a result, present day dogs are
                    the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world. The most striking example of this dispersal
                    is that of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era. The dog has been selectively bred
                    over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape,
                    size, and color.

                    Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems.
                    Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. A study with Rico, a
                    Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by
                    exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A
                    study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and
                    could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language
                    such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands. One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs'
                    capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. One limited
                    study of 18 household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focused on the "what" of a task rather
                    than the "where". Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that
                    Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have
                    lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.

                            The Border Collie is a breed of herding dog of medium size. Widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed,
                            they are descended from landrace sheepdogs once found all over the British Isles, but became standardised in the
                            Anglo-Scottish border region. They are now mostly used as working dogs to herd livestock, specifically sheep.
                            Border Collies are extremely energetic, acrobatic, and athletic. They frequently compete with great success in sheepdog
                            trials and a range of dog sports like dog obedience, disc dog, herding and dog agility. Border Collies continue to be
                            employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.

                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            In general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is more often thick and prone to
                            shedding. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is
                            the most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known
                            to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour
                            (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle,
                            brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some
                            border collies may also have single-colour coats.

                <h3>Shetland Sheepdog</h3>

                            The Shetland Sheepdog, often known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands of
                            Scotland. The original name was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy amongst Rough Collie breeders of the time,
                            so the breed's name was formally changed.[2] This diligent small dog is clever, vocal, excitable and willing to please.
                            They are incredibly trustworthy to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as "shadows" due to their
                            attachment to family. This breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1909.

                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            The general appearance of the Sheltie is that of a miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog,
                            agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark-colored
                            eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good
                            with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an
                            intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed
                            standard.
