                <h2>Information about cats</h2>
                <p>
                    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house
                    cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets
                    but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.
                    Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging
                    from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed
                    cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
                    neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of
                    feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                    reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
                    sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring,
                    trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is
                    a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at
                    dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those
                    made by mice and other small mammals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from
                    around 3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their
                    domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.
                    As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the
                    world. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States,
                    with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one
                    cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9
                    million pet cats as of 2020.

                            Aegean cats (Greek: γάτα του Αιγαίου gáta tou Aigaíou) are a naturally occurring landrace of
                            domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece and western Turkey. It is
                            considered a natural cat, developing without human interference. Development of the
                            Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders in the fledgling Greek cat
                            fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major fancier and breeder
                            organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat.

                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            Aegean cats are a medium-sized, muscular, semi-longhaired cat.[dubious – discuss] The coat is
                            bicolour or tricolour with one of the colours being almost always white. White usually takes up
                            between 1/4 to 9/10 of the body. The colour of their coat might include many other colours and
                            patterns. Their paws are medium in size and have a round shape. Their tail can be long and
                            "hooked". The ears have a wide base and rounded tips and are covered by hair. The eyes have
                            an almond shape and their color can be any shade of green, blue and yellow.
                            Aegean cats are noted for their affinity for water and fishing. Because the breed was allowed
                            to develop through natural selection, rather than selective breeding, Aegean cats are free from
                            most feline genetic diseases.

                <h3>American Bobtail</h3>

                        <p>
                            The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late
                            1960s. It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the
                            length of a normal cat's tail. This is the result of a cat body type genetic mutation
                            affecting the tail development, similar to that of a Manx cat. The breed is not related
                            to the Japanese Bobtail despite the similar name and physical type—the breeding programs are
                            entirely unrelated, and the genetic mutation causing the bobbed tail are known to be
                            different because the mutation causing the American Bobtail's tail is dominant, whereas the
                            Japanese Bobtail tail mutation is recessive

                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            Urban legend says that Bobtails are the result of a cross breeding between a domestic tabby cat
                            and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic
                            mutation within the domestic cat population, and may be related to the Manx gene, which is also
                            dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed brown tabby male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female
                            to create the American Bobtail's original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.
                            This cat's original appearance genetics were modified in the breed to form a new and improved
                            strain which comes in essentially all colors and coat types. The breed was first recognized by
                            The International Cat Association (TICA, US-based), in 1989. The breed has been accepted for
                            championship competition by TICA, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA, also US-based) and the
                            American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA).
