                <h2>Information about cats</h2>
                <p>
                    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house
                    cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets
                    but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact.
                    Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.

                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging
                    from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed
                    cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and
                    neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of
                    feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.

                    The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                    reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and
                    sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring,
                    trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Although the cat is
                    a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at
                    dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those
                    made by mice and other small mammals.

                    It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from
                    around 3100 BC, but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their
                    domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.
                    As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the
                    world. As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States,
                    with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one
                    cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9
                    million pet cats as of 2020.
