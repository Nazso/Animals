                <h2>Information about birds</h2>
                <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers,
                    toothless
                    beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
                    strong yet
                    lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee
                    hummingbird to the 2.8 m
                    (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are
                    passerine, or
                    "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known
                    groups without
                    wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the
                    ability to fly,
                    although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins,
                    and diverse
                    endemic island species.</p>
                <p>Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture.
                    Birds are social,
                    communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as
                    cooperative breeding
                    and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but
                    not necessarily
                    sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for
                    life. Other
                    species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely,
                    polyandrous (one female
                    with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual
                    reproduction. They are
                    usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental
                    care after
                    hatching.</p>
                <p>Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise,
                    birds are considered
                    reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the
                    crocodilians. Birds
                    are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared
                    about 160
                    million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in
                    the Middle to Late
                    Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous" â€“ "Paleogene extinction
                    event 66 mya, which
                    killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
                <p>Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in
                    manufacturing,
                    with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.
                    Songbirds, parrots,
                    and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser.
                    Birds figure
                    throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since
                    the 17th century,
                    and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction,
                    though efforts are
                    underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.
