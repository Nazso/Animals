                <h2>Information about birds</h2>
                <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves, characterised by feathers,
                    toothless
                    beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a
                    strong yet
                    lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee
                    hummingbird to the 2.8 m
                    (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are
                    passerine, or
                    "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known
                    groups without
                    wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the
                    ability to fly,
                    although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins,
                    and diverse
                    endemic island species.</p>
                <p>Many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture.
                    Birds are social,
                    communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as
                    cooperative breeding
                    and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially (but
                    not necessarily
                    sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for
                    life. Other
                    species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely,
                    polyandrous (one female
                    with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual
                    reproduction. They are
                    usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental
                    care after
                    hatching.</p>
                <p>Birds are feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise,
                    birds are considered
                    reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the
                    crocodilians. Birds
                    are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared
                    about 160
                    million years ago (mya) in China. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in
                    the Middle to Late
                    Cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous" – "Paleogene extinction
                    event 66 mya, which
                    killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
                <p>Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in
                    manufacturing,
                    with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.
                    Songbirds, parrots,
                    and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser.
                    Birds figure
                    throughout human culture. About 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since
                    the 17th century,
                    and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction,
                    though efforts are
                    underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.

                            The ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) is a species of hummingbird that
                            generally
                            spends the winter in Central America, Mexico, and Florida, and migrates to Canada and other
                            parts of Eastern North America for the summer to breed. It is by far the most common
                            hummingbird
                            seen east of the Mississippi River in North America.

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        The species is sexually dimorphic. The adult male has a gorget (throat patch) of iridescent ruby
                        red bordered
                        narrowly with velvety black on the upper margin and a forked black tail with a faint violet
                        sheen. The red iridescence
                        is highly directional and appears dull black from many angles. The female has a notched tail
                        with outer feathers banded
                        in green, black, and white and a white throat that may be plain or lightly marked with dusky
                        streaks or stipples. Males
                        are smaller than females and have slightly shorter bills. Juvenile males resemble adult females,
                        though usually with
                        heavier throat markings. The plumage is molted once a year on the wintering grounds, beginning
                        in early fall and
                        ending by late winter.

                            The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in
                            most parts of the world. It is a small bird that has a typical length of 16 cm (6.3 in) and
                            a mass of 24–39.5 g (0.85–1.39 oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and
                            grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25 species in
                            the genus Passer, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin,
                            and a large part of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions,
                            including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely
                            distributed wild bird.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        In mass, the house sparrow ranges from 24 to 39.5 g (0.85 to 1.39 oz). Females usually are
                        slightly smaller than males. The median mass on the European continent for both sexes is about
                        30 g (1.1 oz), and in more southerly subspecies is around 26 g (0.92 oz). Younger birds are
                        smaller, males are larger during the winter, and females are larger during the breeding season.
                        Birds at higher latitudes, colder climates, and sometimes higher altitudes are larger (under
                        Bergmann's rule), both between and within subspecies.

                            The greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus) is a long-legged bird in the cuckoo family,
                            Cuculidae, from the
                            Aridoamerica region in the Southwestern United States and Mexico. The scientific name means
                            "Californian earth-cuckoo".
                            Along with the lesser roadrunner, it is one of two species in the genus Geococcyx. This
                            roadrunner is also known as the
                            chaparral cock, ground cuckoo, and snake killer.

                        <p>
                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        The roadrunner is about 52–62 cm (20–24 in) long, has a 43–61 cm (17–24 in) wingspan and weighs
                        221–538 g (7.8–19.0 oz).
                        It stands around 25–30 cm (9+3⁄4–11+3⁄4 in) tall and is the largest cuckoo of the Americas. The
                        upper body
                        is mostly brown with black streaks and sometimes pink spots. The neck and upper breast are white
                        or pale brown with dark
                        brown streaks, and the belly is white. A crest of brown feathers sticks up on the head, and a
                        bare patch of orange and
                        blue skin lies behind each eye; the blue is replaced by white in adult males (except the blue
                        adjacent to the eye),
                        and the orange (to the rear) is often hidden by feathers. Males and females have identical
                        plumage. Females are
                        slightly smaller, on average 2 cm (3⁄4 in) shorter and 30 g (1.1 oz) lighter than males. The
                        long stout beak is grayish
                        brown to gray and has a hooked tip. Roadrunners have four toes on each zygodactyl foot; two face
                        forward, and two face
                        backward. The toes are brown in color and have pale gold spots.

                        weight of 0.8 to 2.41 kg
                        (1.8 to 5.3 lb). Birds in the northern limit of the species' range average larger in size than
                        the
                        vulture from the neotropics. 124 birds from Florida averaged 2 kg (4.4 lb) while 65 and 130
                        birds from Venezuela were
                        found to average 1.22 and 1.45 kg (2.7 and 3.2 lb), respectively. It displays minimal sexual
                        dimorphism;
                        sexes are identical in plumage and in coloration, and are similar in size. The body feathers are
                        mostly
                        brownish-black, but the flight feathers on the wings appear to be silvery-gray beneath,
                        contrasting with the darker wing
                        linings. The adult's head is small in proportion to its body and is red in color with few to no
                        feathers. It also
                        has a relatively short, hooked, ivory-colored beak. The irises of the eyes are gray-brown; legs
                        and feet are
                        pink-skinned, although typically stained white. The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes
                        on the upper lid and
                        two rows on the lower lid.

                            The Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) is a large seabird that ranges across the
                            North Pacific. The Northwestern
                            Hawaiian Islands are home to 99.7% of the population. This small (for its family) gull-like
                            albatross is the second-most
                            common seabird in the Hawaiian Islands, with an estimated population of 1.18 million birds,
                            and is currently expanding
                            (or possibly re-expanding) its range to new islands. The Laysan albatross was first
                            described as Diomedea immutabilis by
                            Lionel Walter Rothschild, in 1893, on the basis of a specimen from Laysan Island.

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        The Laysan albatross averages 81 cm (32 in) in length[4] and has a wingspan of 195 to 203 cm
                        (77–80 in). Males, which
                        weigh 2.4 to 4.1 kg (5.3–9.0 lb), are larger than females, which weigh 1.9 to 3.6 kg (4.2–7.9
                        lb). This albatross
                        has blackish-gray upperwing, mantle, back, upper rump, and tail, and its head, lower rump, and
                        underparts are white. It
                        has a black smudge around the eye, and its underwing pattern varies between individuals, with
                        some having narrower black
                        margins and variable amounts of black in the underwing coverts. Finally, the bill is pink with a
                        dark tip. Juveniles
                        have a gray bill and a dark upper rump. This species does not have a breeding plumage.

                            The Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a South American penguin, breeding in
                            coastal Patagonia, including Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland Islands, with some migrating
                            to Brazil and Uruguay, where they are occasionally seen as far north as Espirito Santo.
                            Vagrants have been found in El Salvador, the Avian Island in Antarctica, Australia, and New
                            Zealand.[1] It is the most numerous of the Spheniscus banded penguins. Its nearest relatives
                            are the African penguin, the Humboldt penguin, and the Galápagos penguins. The Magellanic
                            penguin was named after Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who spotted the birds in
                            1520.[2] The species is listed as being of Least Concern by the IUCN.

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                            Adults have black backs and white abdomens. There are two black bands between the head and the
                            breast, with the lower band shaped in an inverted horseshoe. The head is black with a broad white border that runs from
                            behind the eye, around the black ear-coverts and chin, and joins at the throat. Chicks and younger penguins have
                            grey-blue backs, with a more faded grey-blue colour on their chest. Magellanic penguins can live up to 25 years in the wild,
                            but as much as 30 years in captivity. Captain Eo, a male Magellanic penguin at the San Francisco Zoo, died in 2022 at
                            the age of 40.
