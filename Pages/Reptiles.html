                <h2>Information about reptiles</h2>
                <p>
                    Reptiles, as most commonly defined, are the animals in the class Reptilia (/rɛpˈtɪliə/
                    rep-TIL-ee-ə), a paraphyletic grouping comprising all sauropsids except birds.[1] Living reptiles
                    comprise turtles, crocodilians, squamates and rhynchocephalians. As
                    of March 2022, the Reptile Database includes about 11,700 species.[2] In the traditional Linnaean
                    classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. However, crocodilians are
                    more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic
                    classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade. Other
                    cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida, which
                    refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. The study of the
                    traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is
                    called herpetology.

                    The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous
                    period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to
                    life on dry land. The earliest known eureptile ("true reptile") was Hylonomus, a small and
                    superficially lizard-like animal. Genetic and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of
                    reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds, and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha (lizards, and kin),
                    diverged near the end of the Permian period.[3] In addition to the living reptiles, there are many
                    diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular, the
                    Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian
                    dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms, and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs). Modern non-bird
                    reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica.

                    Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are
                    descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval
                    stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were
                    some extinct aquatic clades[4]  – the fetus develops within the mother, using a (non-mammalian)
                    placenta rather than contained in an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes
                    for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous
                    species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals, with
                    some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko,
                    Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm (0.7 in) to the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus
                    porosus, which can reach over 6 m (19.7 ft) in length and weigh over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).

                    A herpetarium is a zoological exhibition space for reptiles and amphibians.
                    In the Western world, some snakes (especially relatively docile species such as the ball python and
                    corn snake) are sometimes kept as pets.[170] Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including
                    bearded dragons, iguanas, anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko and the
                    crested gecko).
                    Turtles and tortoises are increasingly popular pets, but keeping them can be challenging due to
                    their particular requirements, such as temperature control, the need for UV light sources, and a
                    varied diet. The long lifespans of turtles and especially tortoises mean they can potentially
                    outlive their owners. Good hygiene and significant maintenance is necessary when keeping reptiles,
                    due to the risks of Salmonella and other pathogens. Regular hand-washing after handling is an
                    important measure to prevent infection.
