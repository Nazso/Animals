                <h2>Information about reptiles</h2>
                <p>
                    Reptiles, as most commonly defined, are the animals in the class Reptilia (/rɛpˈtɪliə/
                    rep-TIL-ee-ə), a paraphyletic grouping comprising all sauropsids except birds.[1] Living reptiles
                    comprise turtles, crocodilians, squamates and rhynchocephalians. As
                    of March 2022, the Reptile Database includes about 11,700 species.[2] In the traditional Linnaean
                    classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. However, crocodilians are
                    more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic
                    classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade. Other
                    cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida, which
                    refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. The study of the
                    traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is
                    called herpetology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous
                    period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to
                    life on dry land. The earliest known eureptile ("true reptile") was Hylonomus, a small and
                    superficially lizard-like animal. Genetic and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of
                    reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds, and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha (lizards, and kin),
                    diverged near the end of the Permian period.[3] In addition to the living reptiles, there are many
                    diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular, the
                    Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all non-avian
                    dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms, and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs). Modern non-bird
                    reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are
                    descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval
                    stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as were
                    some extinct aquatic clades[4]  – the fetus develops within the mother, using a (non-mammalian)
                    placenta rather than contained in an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes
                    for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry land. Many of the viviparous
                    species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals, with
                    some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko,
                    Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm (0.7 in) to the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus
                    porosus, which can reach over 6 m (19.7 ft) in length and weigh over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).

                    A herpetarium is a zoological exhibition space for reptiles and amphibians.
                    In the Western world, some snakes (especially relatively docile species such as the ball python and
                    corn snake) are sometimes kept as pets.[170] Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including
                    bearded dragons, iguanas, anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko and the
                    crested gecko).
                    Turtles and tortoises are increasingly popular pets, but keeping them can be challenging due to
                    their particular requirements, such as temperature control, the need for UV light sources, and a
                    varied diet. The long lifespans of turtles and especially tortoises mean they can potentially
                    outlive their owners. Good hygiene and significant maintenance is necessary when keeping reptiles,
                    due to the risks of Salmonella and other pathogens. Regular hand-washing after handling is an
                    important measure to prevent infection.

                            Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a special shell
                            developed mainly from their ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the
                            Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the
                            way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles,
                            including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on most
                            continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other
                            amniotes (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater,
                            although many species live in or around water.

                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside
                        is the flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin,
                        the material of hair, horns, and claws. The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways
                        and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or
                        "cold-blooded", meaning that their internal temperature varies with their direct environment.
                        They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals with limited
                        movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles are the only reptiles
                        that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach.

                            Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized
                            clade of Old World lizards with 200 species described as of June 2015.[1] The members of
                            this family are best known for their distinct range of colors, being capable of shifting to
                            different hues and degrees of brightness. The large number of species in the family exhibit
                            considerable variability in their capacity to change color. For some, it is more of a shift
                            of brightness (shades of brown); for others, a plethora of color-combinations (reds,
                            yellows, greens, blues) can be seen.

                            <h3>Description</h3>
                            Chameleons vary greatly in size and body structure, with maximum total lengths varying from 15
                            mm (0.59 in) in male Brookesia micra (one of the world's smallest reptiles) to 68.5 cm (27.0 in)
                            in the male Furcifer oustaleti.[36] Many have head or facial ornamentation, such as nasal
                            protrusions, or horn-like projections in the case of Trioceros jacksonii, or large crests on top
                            of their heads, like Chamaeleo calyptratus. Many species are sexually dimorphic, and males are
                            typically much more ornamented than the female chameleons.
                            Some chameleons have a crest of small spikes extending along the spine from the proximal part of
                            the tail to the neck; both the extent and size of the spikes vary between species and
                            individuals. These spikes help break up the definitive outline of the chameleon, which aids it
                            when trying to blend into a background.
