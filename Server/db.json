            "pOne": "The ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) is a species of hummingbird that generally spends the winter in Central America, Mexico, and Florida, and migrates to Canada and other
                    parts of Eastern North America for the summer to breed. It is by far the most common
                    hummingbird seen east of the Mississippi River in North America.",
            "pTwo": "The species is sexually dimorphic. The adult male has a gorget (throat patch) of iridescent ruby
                    red bordered narrowly with velvety black on the upper margin and a forked black tail with a faint violet
                    sheen. The red iridescence is highly directional and appears dull black from many angles. The female has a notched tail
                    with outer feathers banded in green, black, and white and a white throat that may be plain or lightly marked with dusky
                    streaks or stipples. Males are smaller than females and have slightly shorter bills. Juvenile males resemble adult females,
                    though usually with heavier throat markings. The plumage is molted once a year on the wintering grounds, beginning
                    in early fall and ending by late winter."
